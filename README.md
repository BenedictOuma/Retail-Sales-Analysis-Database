# Retail Sales SQL Project

This project simulates a retail sales database and demonstrates advanced SQL skills such as data modeling, query optimization, business logic implementation, and insights extraction.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a structured retail sales system using SQL Server. It includes:

- Customer and product management
- Order tracking and sales analysis
- Employee performance reporting
- Supplier relationship data
- Commission and revenue calculation

## Database Schema

**Tables included:**

- `Customers` – manually created
- `Suppliers` – manually created
- `Employees` – manually created
- `Products` – imported from a CSV file
- `Orders` – imported from a CSV file
- `Sales` – derived using SQL joins and business logic

## Data Preparation

- Manual data entry for `Customers`, `Suppliers`, and `Employees`
- Cleaned CSV import for `Products` and `Orders`
- Transformation of `Orders` into `Sales` through SQL logic

## SQL Concepts Used

- Table creation and constraints
- Data import using `bulk insert`
- Joins and subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temporary tables
- Calculated fields for commission and revenue
- Aggregate functions and grouping
- Clustered indexing for performance

## Insights and Reporting

- Top-performing employees by sales and commission
- Most purchased products and customer purchase trends
- Monthly revenue reports
- Stock movement and product availability
- High-value customers and customer segmentation

## Tools and Technologies

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Excel/CSV for data sourcing
- Git for version control
